# autosave
Automatically save running results of your disposable code.

Software engineers use Git, SVN or other professional tools to mange their code. But scientists use computer as their experiment tools and write codes for scientific computation or simulation. Tools such as Git may seem too professional for their disposable codes. That's why I wrote `autosave`.

Currently supported language: Matlab, Python.

## For Matlab

Use `begin.m` and `over.m`.

## For Python

Use `autosave.py` for Python 2.x and `autosave3.py` for Python 3.x.
